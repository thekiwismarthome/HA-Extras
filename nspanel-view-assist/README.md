# NSPanel Pro 120 — Keep the View Assist app running

A Home Assistant automation that watches the foreground app on a **Sonoff
NSPanel Pro 120** and, if the **View Assist / Home Assistant Companion** app
isn't the app currently running, relaunches it automatically over ADB.

> ℹ️ Copy the automation into your own Home Assistant instance and edit the
> two placeholders (see below).

## How it works

1. A **time-pattern trigger** polls every couple of minutes (plus an extra
   trigger that fires the moment the screen wakes).
2. It checks the NSPanel Pro's `media_player` entity's **`app_id`** attribute,
   which the Android Debug Bridge integration sets to the package name of the
   app currently in the foreground.
3. If `app_id` is **not** the companion app package, it runs an ADB
   `monkey ... LAUNCHER` command to bring the app back to the foreground
   (cold-starting it if it was killed).
4. It then **logs the restart to a file** and raises a **notification** so you
   have a record of how often the app has to be relaunched.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Enable ADB on the NSPanel Pro

On the panel: **Settings → About → tap the build/version number 7 times** to
unlock Developer options, then **Settings → Developer options → enable USB /
Network ADB debugging**. Note the panel's IP address.

### 2. Add the Android Debug Bridge integration

In Home Assistant: **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration →
Android Debug Bridge**.

- **Device type:** Android
- **Host:** the NSPanel Pro's IP address (port `5555`)
- Approve the "Allow USB/Network debugging?" prompt that pops up **on the panel
  screen** the first time HA connects (tick "always allow from this computer").

This creates a `media_player.*` entity for the panel. Rename it if you like,
then use that entity id in the automation.

### 3. Tell the integration which apps to track (so `app_id` populates)

Open the integration's **Configure** dialog and add the companion app to the
**Applications** list so the `app_id` attribute reports it, e.g.:

```
io.homeassistant.companion.android = Home Assistant / View Assist
```

### 4. Set up the File log (`notify.nspanel_watchdog_log`)

The automation writes each restart to a log file through Home Assistant's
**File** notify integration. Set it up once:

**Option A — UI (recommended):** **Settings → Devices & Services → Add
Integration → File**, choose **Notify**, and set:

- **File name:** `nspanel_view_assist_watchdog.log`
- **Add timestamp:** on (optional — the automation also writes its own
  timestamp)
- Name the created entity **`nspanel_watchdog_log`** so it becomes
  `notify.nspanel_watchdog_log`.

The file is written under your HA config directory (e.g.
`/config/nspanel_view_assist_watchdog.log`). Make sure the folder is on your
`allowlist_external_dirs` if you point it elsewhere.

**Option B — YAML** (legacy `notify` platform):

```yaml
notify:
  - platform: file
    name: nspanel_watchdog_log
    filename: nspanel_view_assist_watchdog.log
    timestamp: true
```

> If you'd rather not log to a file, delete the `notify.nspanel_watchdog_log`
> action from the automation — the notification step is independent.

## Install the automation

1. Copy [`automation-nspanel-view-assist.yaml`](./automation-nspanel-view-assist.yaml)
   into your automations (paste it in **Settings → Automations → ⋮ → Edit in
   YAML**, or append it under your `automation:` config).
2. **Find-and-replace the two placeholders** throughout the file:
   - `media_player.nspanel_pro_120` → your panel's `media_player` entity id
   - `io.homeassistant.companion.android` → the app package you want kept alive
3. Reload automations (**Developer Tools → YAML → Automations**) or restart HA.

## Finding the correct app package name

If you aren't using the stock HA Companion app (some View Assist builds use a
different launcher/package), find the real package name from
**Developer Tools → Template** while the app is open on the panel:

```jinja
{{ state_attr('media_player.nspanel_pro_120', 'app_id') }}
```

Or list every package installed on the panel via ADB
(**Developer Tools → Actions → `androidtv.adb_command`**):

```
pm list packages
```

Use whatever package the View Assist app reports, then plug it into the
automation.

## Tuning

- **Check interval** — change `minutes: "/2"` in the time-pattern trigger
  (`"/5"` for every 5 minutes, etc.).
- **Force it on even from standby** — delete the `condition: not` block so the
  watchdog relaunches the app (and wakes the screen) regardless of panel state.
- **Push notification** — the automation raises an in-dashboard
  `persistent_notification` by default. To get a phone push as well, add another
  action after it calling your mobile service, e.g.:

  ```yaml
  - action: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      title: "NSPanel Pro 120 — View Assist restarted"
      message: "Relaunched at {{ when }} (was showing '{{ previous_app }}')."
  ```

- **Log location** — the restart log is written by `notify.nspanel_watchdog_log`
  to `nspanel_view_assist_watchdog.log` in your HA config directory. Tail it to
  see how often the app is being relaunched.
